/**
 * In order for Jupyterlab to pick up changes to @finos/perspective-* in the
 * local working directory, we use `yarn link` to force Jupyterlab to look
 * locally for all `perspective` packages, instead of pulling them from NPM
 * during `jupyter lab install`. This script should be run whenever
 * `jupyter lab clean` has been run, as cleaning the Jupyterlab dir will
 * also break links.
 *
 * This allows us to distribute just the Jupyterlab plugin without inlining
 * the rest of Perspective, but also allows for developers to see their local
 * changes picked up in their current Jupyterlab installation.
 *
 * To set up your Jupyterlab environment with the local
 * `perspective-jupyterlab` plugin, run
 * `jupyter labextension install ./packages/perspective-jupyterlab` to link
 * to the local plugin.
