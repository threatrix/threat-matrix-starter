  title: Improved performance for get, mget and indexing with explicit `_id`s
  body: |-
    The false positive rate for the bloom filter on the `_id` field was reduced from ~10% to ~1%,
    reducing the I/O load if a term is not present in a segment.
    This improves performance when retrieving documents by `_id`, which happens when performing
    get or mget requests, or when issuing `_bulk` requests that provide explicit `_id`s.
