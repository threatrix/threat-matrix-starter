  title: Geohex aggregations on both `geo_point` and `geo_shape` fields
  body: |-
    Previously Elasticsearch 8.1.0 expanded `geo_grid` aggregation support from rectangular tiles (geotile and geohash)
    to include hexagonal tiles, but for `geo_point` only. Now Elasticsearch 8.7.0 will support
    <<geohexgrid-aggregating-geo-shape,Geohex aggregations over `geo_shape`>> as well,
    which completes the long desired need to perform hexagonal aggregations on spatial data.

    In 2018 https://www.uber.com/en-SE/blog/h3/[Uber announced they had open sourced their H3 library],
    enabling hexagonal tiling of the planet for much better analytics of their traffic and regional pricing models.
    The use of hexagonal tiles for analytics has become increasingly popular, due to the fact that each tile represents
    a very similar geographic area on the planet, as well as the fact that the distance between tile centers is
    very similar in all directions, and consistent across the map.
    These benefits are now available to all Elasticsearch users.
