  title: Downsampling GA
  body: |-
    <<downsampling,Downsampling>> is a feature that reduces the number of stored documents in Elasticsearch
    time series indices, resulting in smaller indices and improved query latency.
    This optimization is achieved by pre-aggregating time series indices,
    using the time_series index schema to identify the time series.
    Downsampling is configured as an action in ILM, making it a useful tool for managing large volumes of
    time series data in Elasticsearch.
