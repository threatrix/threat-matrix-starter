  title: Improved downsampling performance
  body: |-
    Several improvements were made to the performance of downsampling.
    All hashmap lookups were removed.
    Also metrics/label producers were modified so that they extract the doc_values directly from the leaves.
    This allows for extra optimizations for cases such as labels/counters that do not extract doc_values
    unless they are consumed. Those changes yielded a 3x-4x performance improvement of the downsampling operation, as measured by our benchmarks.
