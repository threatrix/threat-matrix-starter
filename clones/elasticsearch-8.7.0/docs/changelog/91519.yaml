  title: Time series (TSDS) GA
  body: |-
    <<tsds,Time Series Data Stream (TSDS)>> is a feature for optimizing Elasticsearch indices for time series data.
    This involves sorting the indices to achieve better compression and using synthetic _source to reduce index size.
    As a result, TSDS indices are significantly smaller than non-time_series indices that contain the same data.
    TSDS is particularly useful for managing time series data with high volume.
