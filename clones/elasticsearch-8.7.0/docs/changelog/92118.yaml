  title: Allow more than one KNN search clause
  body: |-
    Some vector search scenarios require relevance ranking using a few kNN clauses,
    e.g. when ranking based on several fields, each with its own vector, or when a document
    includes a vector for the image and another vector for the text. The user may want to obtain
    relevance ranking based on a combination of all of these kNN clauses.
