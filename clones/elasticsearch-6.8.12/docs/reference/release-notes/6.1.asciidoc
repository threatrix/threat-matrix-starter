incorrectly deemed to be hexadecimal numbers. For more information, see
{ml-docs}/ml-configuring-categories.html[Categorizing log messages].
* Reduced the sensitivity of the analysis to small perturbations in the input
data.
* Disabled the ability to create forecasts for jobs that were created before
6.1.0.

* Added a `cluster_alerts.management.blacklist` setting for HTTP Exporters,
which you can use to block the creation of specific cluster alerts. For more
information, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

Network::
* Only bind loopback addresses when binding to local {es-pull}28029[#28029]

Recovery::
* Allow shrinking of indices from a previous major {es-pull}28076[#28076] (issue: {es-issue}28061[#28061])

* Fixed an issue in the Active Directory realm when following referrals that
resulted in an increase in the number of connections made to Active Directory.
* Fixed exception that occurred when using auditing and transport clients. In
particular, the problem occurred when the number of processors on the transport

* Ensured that TLS is not required to install a license if you are using
single-node discovery. For more information, see <<single-node-discovery>> and
<<ssl-tls>>.

* Improve shard-failed log messages. {es-pull}26866[#26866]

Machine Learning::
* Improved the way {ml} jobs are allocated to nodes, such that it is primarily

information about the job's memory requirements, the allocation decision is based
on job counts per node.
* Increased the default value of the `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting from `10`
to `20`. The allocation of jobs to nodes now considers memory usage as well as
job counts, so it's reasonable to permit more small jobs on a single node. For
more information, see <<ml-settings>>.
* Decreased the default `model_memory_limit` property value to 1 GB for new jobs.
If you want to create a job that analyzes high cardinality fields, you can
increase this property value. For more information, see <<ml-apilimits>>.
* Improved analytics related to decay rates when predictions are very accurate.
* Improved analytics related to detecting non-negative quantities and using this
information to constrain analysis, predictions, and confidence intervals.
* Improved periodic trough or spike detection.
* Improved the speed of the aggregation of {ml} results.
* Improved probability calculation performance.
* Expedited bucket processing time in very large populations by determining when
there are nearly duplicate values in a bucket and de-duplicating the samples that
are added to the model.
* Improved handling of periodically missing values.
* Improved analytics related to diurnal periodicity.
* Reduced memory usage during population analysis by releasing redundant memory
after the bucket results are written.
* Improved modeling of long periodic components, particularly when there is a
long bucket span.

Mapping::
* Allow ip_range to accept CIDR notation {es-pull}27192[#27192] (issue: {es-issue}26260[#26260])
