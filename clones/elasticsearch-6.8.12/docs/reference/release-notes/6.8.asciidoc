This issue is fixed in Elasticsearch 6.8.10 and 7.7.1.

* Java based - formats with '8' prefix - week based parsing and calculations are using JDK default calendar data provider which is Sunday,1.
Sunday is considered first day of a week and it requires only 1 day in a week to for the first week of the year.
It can be worked around by using locale which is based on ISO8601 rule (Monday,4) - for instance en-GB
