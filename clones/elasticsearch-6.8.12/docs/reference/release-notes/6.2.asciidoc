Deprecated multi-argument versions of the request methods in the RestClient.
Prefer the "Request" object flavored methods. ({es-pull}30315[#30315])

//[float]
//=== New Features

A new analysis plugin called `analysis_nori` that exposes the Lucene Korean
analysis module.  ({es-pull}30397[#30397])

[float]

Highlighting::
* Limit analyzed text for highlighting (improvements) {es-pull}28808[#28808] (issues: {es-issue}16764[#16764], {es-issue}27934[#27934]) 

<<copy-source-settings-on-resize,Allow copying source settings on index resize operations>> ({es-pull}30255[#30255], {es-pull}30404[#30404])

Added new "Request" object flavored request methods in the RestClient. Prefer
these instead of the multi-argument versions. ({es-pull}29623[#29623])

Recovery::
* Require translogUUID when reading global checkpoint {es-pull}28587[#28587] (issue: {es-issue}28435[#28435])
Added `setJsonEntity` to `Request` object so it is marginally easier to send JSON. ({es-pull}30447[#30447])
Watcher HTTP client used in watches now allows more parallel connections to the
same endpoint and evicts long running connections. ({es-pull}30130[#30130])

The cluster state listener to decide if watcher should be
stopped/started/paused now runs far less code in an executor but is more
synchronous and predictable. Also the trigger engine thread is only started on
data nodes. And the Execute Watch API can be triggered regardless is watcher is

Machine Learning::
* Fixed the <<ml-get-datafeed-stats,get datafeed statistics API>> such that it
returns only machine learning-specific node attributes.

Monitoring::
* Aligned reporting of index statistics that exist in the current cluster state.
This fix avoids subtle race conditions in stats reporting.

Packaging::
* Delay path expansion on Windows {es-pull}28753[#28753] (issues: {es-issue}27675[#27675], {es-issue}28748[#28748])

mappings automatically. Maintenance is necessary, for example, when new fields
are introduced or document types change.

`nameid.allow_create` setting and changed the default value for
the SPNameQualifier setting to blank. See <<saml-realm>>.

parameters. See <<saml-realm>>.

tries to write the status field twice.
* Fixed TransformInput toXContent serialization errors. For more information,
see <<_transforming_chained_input_data>>.

Auto-expand replicas when adding or removing nodes to prevent shard copies from
being dropped and resynced when a data node rejoins the cluster ({es-pull}30423[#30423])

Machine Learning::
* Fixed an exception that occurred when a categorization field contained an
empty string.

Monitoring::

Security::
* Added CachingRealm to published artifacts so it can be used in custom realm
extensions.
* If the realm uses native role mappings and the security index health changes,
the realm caches are cleared. For example, they are cleared when the index
recovers from a red state, when the index is deleted, when the index becomes
outdated, and when the index becomes up-to-date.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent auditing to a remote index if the remote
cluster was re-started at the same time as the audited cluster.
* Removed AuthorityKeyIdentifier's Issuer and Serial number from certificates
generated by `certgen` and `certutil`. This improves compatibility with
certificate verification in {kib}.

Watcher::
* Proxies now use HTTP by default, which was the default prior to 6.0. This
fixes issues with HTTPS requests that tried to access proxies via HTTP.
* Fixed the HTML sanitizer settings
(`xpack.notification.email.html.sanitization.*`), which were broken in 6.2. For
more information, see <<notification-settings>>.

functionality is available, which opens up the possibility of sensibly

* Improved the sensitivity of the analysis to high variance data with lots of
values near zero.
* Improved the decay rate of the model memory by using a weighted moving average.
* Machine learning indices created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, {ml} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Changed the credentials that are used by {dfeeds}. When {security} is enabled,
a {dfeed} stores the roles of the user who created or updated the {dfeed}
**at that time**. This means that if those roles are updated, the {dfeed}
subsequently runs with the new permissions that are associated with the roles.
However, if the user's roles are adjusted after creating or updating the {dfeed}
then the {dfeed} continues to run with the permissions that are associated with
the original roles. For more information, see
{ml-docs}/ml-dfeeds.html[Datafeeds].
* Added a new `scheduled` forecast status, which indicates that the forecast
has not started yet.

* Allow `_doc` as a type. {es-pull}27816[#27816] (issues: {es-issue}27750[#27750], {es-issue}27751[#27751])

Monitoring::
* {monitoring} indices (`.monitoring`) created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, monitoring indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Added a cluster alert that triggers whenever a node is added, removed, or
restarted.

Security::
* Added the ability to refresh tokens that were created by the token API. The

hours of its creation to extend the life of a token. For more information, see
<<security-api-tokens>>.
* Added principal and role information to `access_granted`, `access_denied`,
`run_as_granted`, and `run_as_denied` audit events. For more information about
these events, see <<auditing>>.
* Added audit event ignore policies, which are a way to tune the verbosity of an
audit trail. These policies define rules for ignoring audit events that match
specific attribute values. For more information, see
<<audit-log-ignore-policy>>.
* Added a certificates API, which enables you to retrieve information about the
X.509 certificates that are used to encrypt communications in your {es} cluster.

Watcher::
* Added the ability to set the `index` and `doc_type` dynamically in an index
action. For more information, see <<actions-index>>.
* Added a `refresh` index action attribute, which enables you to set the
refresh policy of the write request. For more information, see
<<actions-index>>.
* Added support for actions in slack attachments, which enables you to add
buttons that can be clicked in slack messages. For more information, see
<<actions-slack>>.
* {watcher} indices (`.watch*` and `triggered_watches`) created after upgrading
to 6.2 have the `auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting
of 1 replica. As a result, {watcher} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can
have a green status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node
clusters.

for model plots. This inconsistency resulted in problems plotting these buckets
