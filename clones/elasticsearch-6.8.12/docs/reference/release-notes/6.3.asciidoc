[[release-notes-6.3.0]]
== {es} version 6.3.0

[float]
=== Known issues

Upgrades from any 5.x version will fail for indexes which are prepared using the <<indices-synced-flush, _synced flush API>>,
or were automatically sync-flushed due to inactivity. If upgrading from those versions, please
wait for 6.3.1 to be released.

Clusters with a Gold or Platinum license that are upgrading to 6.3 will need to explicitly set
`xpack.security.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml` to upgrade successfully.
If this value is not set, the cluster will be unable to form after upgrade.

Also see <<breaking-changes-6.3>>.

[[breaking-6.3.0]]
[float]
=== Breaking changes

Core::
* Rename the bulk thread pool to write thread pool {es-pull}29593[#29593]

Monitoring::
* By default when you install {xpack}, monitoring is enabled but data collection
is disabled. To enable data collection, use the new
`xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting. You can update this setting by
using the <<cluster-update-settings,Cluster Update Settings API>>. For more
information, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

Packaging::
* Create keystore on package install {es-pull}28928[#28928]

Plugins::
* Remove silent batch mode from install plugin {es-pull}29359[#29359]

with an SPI based extension mechanism that is installed and built as an
elasticsearch plugin.
