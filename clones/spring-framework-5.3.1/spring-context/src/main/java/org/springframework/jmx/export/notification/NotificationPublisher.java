/**
 * Simple interface allowing Spring-managed MBeans to publish JMX notifications
 * without being aware of how those notifications are being transmitted to the
 * {@link javax.management.MBeanServer}.
 *
 * <p>Managed resources can access a {@code NotificationPublisher} by
 * implementing the {@link NotificationPublisherAware} interface. After a particular
 * managed resource instance is registered with the {@link javax.management.MBeanServer},
 * Spring will inject a {@code NotificationPublisher} instance into it if that
 * resource implements the {@link NotificationPublisherAware} interface.
 *
 * <p>Each managed resource instance will have a distinct instance of a
 * {@code NotificationPublisher} implementation. This instance will keep
 * track of all the {@link javax.management.NotificationListener NotificationListeners}
 * registered for a particular mananaged resource.
 *
 * <p>Any existing, user-defined MBeans should use standard JMX APIs for notification
 * publication; this interface is intended for use only by Spring-created MBeans.
